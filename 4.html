    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <hr>


    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The history of computers began with <b>mechanical devices</b> such as the abacus,
        which was used thousands of years ago. Later, Charles Babbage proposed the
        <u>Analytical Engine</u>, which is considered the
        <strong>first concept of a programmable computer</strong>.
        His ideas were ahead of their time, and although his designs were never fully built,
        they laid the foundation for <em>modern computing</em>.
        Ada Lovelace, who worked with Babbage, is often recognized as the
        world’s first programmer.
        These early ideas show how human imagination paved the way for technology that would
        later change the world.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The evolution of computers is often described in <b>generations</b>.
        The first generation relied on vacuum tubes, which were large,
        expensive, and generated a lot of heat.
        The second generation introduced <i>transistors</i>, making computers smaller and faster.
        The third generation made use of <u>integrated circuits</u>,
        revolutionizing processing power.
        By the fourth generation, computers were built around the
        <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> microprocessor,
        making them affordable for everyday people.
        Finally, the fifth generation saw advances in <em>artificial intelligence</em>
        and <strong>network connectivity</strong>,
        making the computer an essential tool of the modern era.

        Mathematics has also played an important role in computing.
        For example, the famous equation: E = mc<sup>2</sup>.
        Another scientific notation is water: H<sub>2</sub>O.
        Such mathematical and scientific notations are crucial in computer simulations and programming.

    <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet began as ARPANET, a U.S. defense project,
        but quickly expanded into a global communication network.
        In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed the
        <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>,
        which introduced the concepts of <b>websites</b> and <i>hyperlinks</i>.
        The World Wide Web transformed the way people
        <em>shared knowledge</em> and connected across the globe.
        Today, it is impossible to imagine life without it.
        A famous saying reflects this transformation:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        "The power of the Web is in its universality.
        Access by everyone regardless of disability is
        an essential aspect." – <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>
        In the modern era, computers have evolved into <small>tiny devices</small>
        that fit in our pockets. We now use <del>dial-up</del> <ins>broadband</ins>
        and high-speed fiber connections.
        Smartphones, tablets, and laptops have become everyday tools,
        enabling us to <strong>work</strong>, <i>learn</i>, and <u>socialize</u>
        instantly across the globe.
        Technologies like <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
        and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
        have become the backbone of the Internet.
        Even voice assistants and artificial intelligence rely on
        <em>cloud computing</em> to process vast amounts of data.

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <p>
        To display text on a webpage, you can use the following code snippet:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Another example of computer interaction:
        Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text. <br>
        System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
    </p>

    <p>
        In programming, variables are often written as <var>x</var> or <var>y</var>.
        A typical mathematical function might look like f(<var>x</var>) = x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1.
        Such formulas are commonly implemented in <code>Python</code>, <code>Java</code>,
        or other <em>programming languages</em>.
